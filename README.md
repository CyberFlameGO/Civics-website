# Civics-website



This website is being made for a porject in my civics class.
The project is to create a city and must meet requirements.
This website is not required but I am making it to present our informtion better.

DISCLAIMER!

The code for this website is horrable. It looks terrable from the file point of view. 
When this is finnished and presented I may fix the code.

Due date = 3/9/22 (My bday lol)
